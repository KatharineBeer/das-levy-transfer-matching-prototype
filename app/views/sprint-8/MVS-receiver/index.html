               <p>As a business of any size, you can use this service to apply for funding from large businesses that want to fund 100% of your apprenticeship training costs.</p>

               <p>They can fund your apprenticeship training by transferring some of their apprenticeship levy.</p>

               <p><strong>As a business looking for this funding, you will need:</strong></p>

               <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>an apprenticeship service account to apply for and receive funding</li>
                    <li>to think about the type of apprenticeship training you need</li>
                    <li>to think about how many apprentices you need</li>
               </ul>

               <p><strong>You can:</strong></p>

               <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>browse details of funding opportunities</li>
                    <li>apply to be considered for funding</li>
                    <li>apply to more than one opportunity</li>

               <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about-funding">Getting 95% apprenticeship funding from the government instead</h2>

               <p>Businesses that don't pay the apprenticeship levy can get 95% of their apprenticeship training costs funded by the government, so they only pay 5%.</p>

               <p>So if you're unsuccessful in getting funding from a large business to pay for 100% of your training costs, you'll still only have to pay 5%.</p>

               <p>To get 95% government funding you'll need to log into or register for an <a href="#">apprenticeship service account</a>.</p>
