               <p>The maximum amount you can pledge is <strong>Â£200,000</strong>. This is based on your transfer allowance and is valid for the current financial year.</p>

               <p>When you renew the pledge - or create a new pledge - for the following year we assume that your transfer allowance will remain the same.</p>

               <p>Your transfer allowance is calculated every April but only appears on your account by the end of April. It is based on the total amount of levy you declared during the previous tax year.</p>
